 urviksten_naugsvol_avnkaup_title:0 "Eastern Jarls"
 urviksten_naugsvol_avnkaup_desc:0 "Olavlund has always been fractured among small Jarldoms precariously perched between sea and mountains. Urviksten has prided itself on being the largest, although the truth is that the land is nothing but rock and crag. The Ebonfrosts of Urviksten cannot last forever as lords of empty mountains: we must integrate the lowlands of Naugsvol and Avnkaup, by force if necessary."
 urviksten_fortify_against_graytide_title:0 "Fortify Against the Graytide"
 urviksten_fortify_against_graytide_desc:0 "Our warriors might be the best in all of Gerudia, that talent wanes in the sight of the monstrous gray beasts that have emerged from the Northern Pass past the Giants Tears. The Gray Beasts have subjugated our old enemies of Vrorenmarch in one fell swoop. But we are not Reachmen, we are Gerudians! We adapt where they remain rigid. The Reachmen failed to defend their many castles: we will remain vigilant for the inevitable attack, and we will be ready with fortifications that will give them dread!"
 urviksten_assemble_the_men_title:0 "Assemble the Men!"
 urviksten_assemble_the_men_desc:0 "'Hear me, men of Urviksten! You are descendants of many heroes, from Urvik to Castan Ebonfrost. We have fought to protect our homes from the Reachmen, and we have fought to take what is ours from them. To the south Vrorenmarch has been dyed Gray with Orcs, foul monsters whose green kin had slain Castanor. But we Gerudians slay monsters! They are naught but larger men who bleed and die, that fight with might not from skill but from their inherited brawn. Warriors of Urviksten, follow me, heir of Castan Ebonfrost, for together we will drive these beasts from our lands and we will unite our brethren!'"
 urviksten_descendants_of_castan_ebonfrost_title:0 "Lineage of Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_descendants_of_castan_ebonfrost_desc:0 "The Ebonfrost dynasty is known infamously throughout all of Cannor as great conquerors and warriors. In 865 AA Castan Ebonfrost, once a lowly Reaver, rose to greatness when he conquered all of Castanor in one year. He secured his rule by passing their Trials after smashing his way past their armies, and forever changed the Trials to be available only for his hereditary heir. His dynasty ruled Castanor until 1015 AA, when Castan LIII's enthrallment was broken which led to his death by Nichmer the Sorceror King. Fortunately he was succeeded by two sons and a daughter: Garrec unsuccessfully attempting to reclaim Castanor, the Urvic went north and reclaimed his namesake, Castan Ebonfrost's ancestral home of Urviksten, and Alvara married Urion Starsworn of Silurion fame. We are the descendants of these great men and women. I will not let the Ebonfrost name down."
 urviksten_blood_of_victors_title:0 "Blood of Victors"
 urviksten_blood_of_victors_desc:0 "The strength of the Ebonfrosts is no coincidence, it is a direct heritage of our dynasty. From Castan Ebonfrost to Urvik to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the Ebonfrosts have all been physically powerful, as well as being pale as snow and hair dark as a raven. The Gerudians respect strength: let us ensure that they do not see a lack of that in us."
 urviksten_olavlund_title:0 "Heart of Olavlund"
 urviksten_olavlund_desc:0 "The Gerudians of the Giant's Grave Sea are named after the ancient hero Olav. Said to have been the son of Urvik, Olav brought the Gerudian peoples further into their new homeland to where Redgarhavn and Skaldol now stand. Although his ancient hall of Olavsborg has fallen in significance, the lands adjacent still resonate as the heart of the eastern Gerudians. Control over Skaldol the spiritual heart, and Redgarhavn the secular brain, will allow for Urviksten to assert itself as the true ruler of all Olavish."
 urviksten_claim_the_giants_tears_title:0 "Claim the Giant's Tears"
 urviksten_claim_the_giants_tears_desc:0 "It is not enough to wait for the Orcs to attack us, for they will not perish on their own. Past the southern borders of Urviksten the mirelands of Jotunstar are infested with gray beasts, the very same land that Urvic Ebonfrost crossed to reclaim his homeland after the fall of Castanor. Where this land was once the bridge for the return of the Ebonfrosts to Urviksten, it will serve again as a bridge for our return to Vrorenmarch and all of Castanor!"
 urviksten_castletown_title:0 "Urviksten Castletown"
 urviksten_castletown_desc:0 "Following the construction of the new fortifications in Urviksten, the prosperity of the town rekindled. Safe within the walls and embankments, trade prospered and families grew, bringing relevance to Urviksten not seen since the legendary days of the first Urvik. Where once this was known as the cave where Urvik and the first Gerudians fought the Trolls valiantly, Urviksten is now a walled city and a vision of the future for Olavlund."
 urviksten_settle_esfjall_title:0 "Settle Esfjall"
 urviksten_settle_esfjall_desc:0 "Esfjall was the borderland of Urviksten, scarcely more populated than the mirelands of the Jotunstar. Following the conquest of the Jotunstar and the prosperity of Urviksten town, Esfjall was no longer beset by the many perils of a borderland. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Urviksten funded the settlement of these lands to establish control over the new Jotunstar marches."
 urviksten_ebonfrosts_landing_title:0 "Path of Castan Ebonfrost"
 urviksten_ebonfrosts_landing_desc:0 "Vrorenmarch was the first land ruled by Castan Ebonfrost: it will be our first step to reclaiming his legacy. In his day the land was a puppet of Castanor that foolishly thought they play puppetmaster with the first Ebonfrost. Now Vrorenmarch is a shadow of its past, squatted on by Gray Orcs while the Reachmen live as their servants. We must take Ebonfrosts first holding back from the Orcs, for then the route to Escann will be open to us."
 urviksten_gifrbygd_title:0 "Hunt the Troll Lands"
 urviksten_gifrbygd_desc:0 "Beyond the eastern Titan's Rest Mountains is a vast wilderness still haunted by Trolls. Far Gerudia has served as a hunting ground for Gerudians looking for fame but has always been too dangerous for habitation. Even without the threat of the Trolls, harsh winters and meagre food make this a land of starvation far worse than even the backwaters in Olavlund. Untold riches await us in the north, hoarded by the Trolls. Let us seize them for ourselves!"
 urviksten_alenic_title:0 "Alenic Gerudians"
 urviksten_alenic_desc:0 "The Alenic Reach was settled by Gerudians since time immemorial, but after the end of Elkaesal the White's tyranny in the Era of Frost those who remained in the Reach have become more like the Alenics and the Escanni. The majority of the Reachmen follow the Regent Court, although there are some who follow the Skaldhyrric Faith as a result of regimes lead by Reavers and by Castan Ebonfrosts invasion. This Skaldhyrric minority is ours to protect: we must ensure that they do not face the threat of Gray Orcs or other invaders again!"
 urviksten_alenic_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on §YWhite Reachmen§! provinces in §YAlenic Reach§! Region."
 urviksten_bay_of_chills_title:0 "Thaw the Trade"
 urviksten_bay_of_chills_desc:0 "The Bay of Chills was once flush with trade from the Reachmen and prowled by Reavers, but since the conquest of Vrorenmarch by the Gray Orcs most of the eastern trade has frozen like winter ice. Now that we have ended the Orcish invasion the Reachmen have no reason to fear the seas: now our Reavers will protect the traders for a small protection fee."
 urviksten_balmire_title:0 "Rebuild Balmire"
 urviksten_balmire_desc:0 "One of Castanor's mighty fortresses built by Balgar the Builder, Bal Mire has marked the western border of Castanor. During the Greentide it was occupied by foul green Orcs, but the worst fear is for the fort to be occupied by the Gawedi. If Urviksten is to reclaim Castanor we must ensure that its western border is free from the Alenic eagle."
 urviksten_alen_trade_title:0 "Secure the Alen River"
 urviksten_alen_trade_desc:0 "The mighty Alen River has its roots in northern Escann, connecting the markets of Castonath and the Silvermere towns with the Gawedi. This trade has brought prosperity to both lands in the past, but Gawed threatens our trade rights over the Upper Alen. The Gawedi see themselves as children and heirs of the Alen river, claiming that the whole of the river should be theirs. Let us make an example of those who would threaten our rights as lords of Castonath."
 urviksten_repair_western_forts_title:0 "West Castanorian Fortifications"
 urviksten_repair_western_forts_desc:0 "Bal Mire is the mightiest of Castanor's western border forts, but it is not the only one. The western border does not only hold the Gawedi back: there are also the pompous Arbarani half-elves, the isolated and ruthless Ibevari elves, and those Aldresian spellblades. Worse, the Orcs and the adventurer squatters have claimed these lands: we must assert and fortify our rightful claim with brick and mortar."
 urviksten_gerudian_trials_title:0 "Gerudian Trials"
 urviksten_gerudian_trials_desc:0 "The Trials of Castan were altered forever when Castan Ebonfrost changed them to be only available to his designated heir, but they were rigged for the heir to succeed. Let us reconstitute this policy of solidifying the stability of our nation, starting with a renovation of the old North Citadel as a cover for this operation."
 urviksten_nyr_ebonmarck_title:0 "Nyr Ebonmarck"
 urviksten_nyr_ebonmarck_desc:0 "Following the ascension of Castan Ebonfrost to the throne of Castanor, Ebonmarck was resettled by Gerudians. This duchy was known for its loyal and mighty warriors, most famous of all the aptly named Ebon Guard. The loyalty of the province held true after the fall of Castanor in the War of the Sorceror King. Garrec Ebonfrost ruled Ebonmarck in these tumultuous times, striving to reclaim the kingdom, but was defeated by the Kingdom of Vrorenmarch. Now Ebonmarck is empty, its towns and temples both Skaldhyrric and Regent Court but rubble after the Greentide. Ebonmarck will be rebuilt as a shining example of our return to Castanor!"
 urviksten_breach_westgate_title:0 "Breach Westgate"
 urviksten_breach_westgate_desc:0 "The White Walls of Castanor guard the ancient city of Castonath from the Serpentspine to the Silvermere. Westgate was the primary gate on the western segment of the walls, the site of many battles over many centuries of those attempting to enter Inner Castanor. Following the Greentide it may not be necessary to control Westgate to enter, but it would give us security and legitimacy."
 urviksten_trialmount_title:0 "Trialmount"
 urviksten_trialmount_desc:0 "The symbol of Castanor second only to Castonath itself, the Trialmount is where every claimant has undergone the Trials of Castan. If we are to prove ourselves as the heirs of Castan we must reclaim the mountain!"
 urviksten_castonath_title:0 "Heart of Castanor"
 urviksten_castonath_desc:0 "What was once the beating heart of Halann's greatest empire is now a smoldering ruin of overgrown pavement. What has been lost may be rebuilt, for much of the city can be repaired and the rest salvaged for building materials. Once more will the Ebonfrosts rule this great city, all those who stand in our way will kneel or be cast done!"
 urviksten_castanor_title:0 "Resurgence of Black Castanor"
 urviksten_castanor_desc:0 "The reclamation of Castonath has seen a miracle of reconstruction under the Ebonfrosts, with empty ruined streets cleared and ancient halls converted into Skaldhyrric temples and mead halls. The Ebonfrosts have made this all possible, but we will not be seen as Castans if we just rule the city. Those who tried to reclaim the empire in the past, and had only controlled Castonath, fell apart due to civil war or other disasters. Not only must Castonath be rebuilt, but the lands that feed it."
 urviksten_white_walls_tt:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YWhite Walls of Castanor§!."
 urviksten_onyx_fleet_title:0 "Onyx Fleet"
 urviksten_onyx_fleet_desc:0 "The Reaver fleets of old were designed as raiding ships for crossing wild seas and upriver, not designed for open war. With prime timber from the Black Pines, we must build new ships, ones that can carry the immense weight of cannons while being resistant to enemy fire. The Ebonfrost fleets will rule the waves in likes never seen since the Era of Black Frost!"
 urviksten_far_gerudian_rangers_title:0 "Far Gerudian Rangers"
 urviksten_far_gerudian_rangers_desc:0 "Far Gerudia was not as replete with Troll riches as we once thought. The Golden Forest may exist, but it is as the tales say, a cautionary tale for those seeking great wealth. But there are some spoils of the taiga: furry and woolly creatures yield valuable pelts, and prime timber and sap can be found for boat construction. The problem is that this wilderness is ever plagued by Trolls and bandits who prey on our countrymen. We must establish a taskforce to patrol Far Gerudia against these threats."
 urviksten_black_pines_title:0 "Black Pines"
 urviksten_black_pines_desc:0 "The mountain vales of Urviksten hold iron-hard Black Pines. Long seen as a detriment due to the hardship of cutting them, with modern techniques they can be felled. Unaltered they make perfect posts or beams, far outperforming other timber, and as planks they can now be shaped as flexibly while retaining much more strength."
 urviksten_restart_ebonsteel_forge_title:0 "Restart the Ebonsteel Forge"
 urviksten_restart_ebonsteel_forge_desc:0 "An ancient artifact of unknown origin, the Ebonsteel Forge has produced the finest axes and armor of Urviksten and possibly all of Gerudia. Fueled by Black Pines, the forge radiates with heat far stronger than other forges, enough to melt the natural Ebonsteel alloy found in rock formations of Urviksten. The forge has lain silent for too long: when Urvic Ebonfrost reclaimed his home a resentful rival sabotaged the forge, resulting in its destruction and the near death of Urvic. The forge may yet still be repaired, whoever does so will wield steel far superior than all others."
 urviksten_northern_pass_title:0 "Origin of the Graytide"
 urviksten_northern_pass_desc:0 "Beyond the Jotunstar and north of the Serpentspine, the Gray Orcs gathered to invade Vrorenmarch and Gerudia. Never again will we be threatened by monstrous invasion! We have stopped their invasion, but there is no guarantee the threat is over. The Northern Pass where they muster be seized and pacified, we cannot wait for the dwarves to end this threat! The fate of Escann will never happen again, not in Escann or Gerudia or anywhere!"
