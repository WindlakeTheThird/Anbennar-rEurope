    #1st Column
    G55_1_1_petition_degakheion_title: "Petition Degakheion"
    G55_1_1_petition_degakheion_desc: "We are the first Nékhei, in rank, founding, prestige, and size. We have long been the most preeminent of the Devandi kheions, a position which we intend to keep. Unfortunately, we have had to watch with great dissatisfaction as our cousins have grown and come to challenge us. If only we had a way to forcefully put them in their place. Thankfully, our parent kheion has ambitions of their own. They seek the unification of the Kheionai under their leadership. These 2 goals are not incompatible, and in fact perfectly complement one another. We will send diplomats to Degakheion, to negotiate a settlement that will help both them and us achieve our ambitions."
    G55_1_3_prepare_the_conquest_title: "Prepare The Conquest"
    G55_1_3_prepare_the_conquest_desc: "Our goal is clear; the dream of a unified Devand under our leadership. Even with the aid of our overlord, however, it will be a costly and difficult venture. We must prepare well before we embark upon this great undertaking."
    G55_1_4_slavers_bay_title: "Slavers Bay"
    G55_1_4_slavers_bay_desc: "To our north lie the kheions of Keyolíon and Empkeios. Well known for their widespread use of slavery and plantations, they stand in our way towards the unification of Devand. We must be careful, for our Basobhar auxiliaries have a deep, seething hatred of these 2 cities, and would like to see them wiped off the map if given the chance. Our merchants, however, seek the valuable ports Keyolíon and Empkeios have, and implore us to annex the kheions as quickly as possible."
    G55_1_5_fortify_the_gap_title: "Fortify The Gap"
    G55_1_5_fortify_the_gap_desc: "Between the Chendhyan plains and the Devandi Coast lies a set of mountains, effectively cutting off both areas from each other. Unfortunately, there's a mountain pass near Empkeios, allowing Chendhyan riders to bypass the city, and raid our lands, and those of our fellow nékheis, with impunity. This must change, in order for our northern frontiers to be secured. Our engineers have drawn up an ambitious design for an impenetrable mountain fortress that will block the northern pass into our lands. While expensive, it is essential for our defense."

    #2nd Column
    G55_2_2_build_up_eneion_title: "Build Up Eneion"
    G55_2_2_build_up_eneion_desc: "Our kheion was the first to be built east of The Cleaved Sea, and for generations we have maintained our status as the first nékheis, in both size and prestige. The other nékheis seem to have begun challenging our title, seeking to become bigger than us. Our government officials have proposed a range of building projects and renovations, in order to bring our great city to new heights. A plan which we must implement!"
    G55_2_4_squash_the_rabble_title: "Squash The Rabble"
    G55_2_4_squash_the_rabble_desc: "To our south lay the kheions of Apikhoxi and Besolaki. Primarily descended from, and ruled by lower class settlers from Alecand, these kheions are quite hostile to any sort of rule by us. As such, they are our enemies, and stand in our way of our goals. We will conquer them, and squash this rabble."
    G55_2_5_consolidate_devand_title: "Consolidate Devand"
    G55_2_5_consolidate_devand_desc: "It is done. Almost the entirety of Devand is under our rule. All that's left is territories under our overlords’ control, and Deyeion. Our diplomats are already working on a compromise that would see these holdouts brought into our domain, which would at last see us achieve the dream we have worked so hard for."

    #3rd Column
    G55_3_1_settle_the_borderland_title: "Settle The Borderland"
    G55_3_1_settle_the_borderland_desc: "Between us and Besolakí to our south lives many Basobhar tribes, living out an existence upon a windy plain. For generations, these tribes have kept an alliance with our humble kheion, and on numerous occasions we have helped each other against any that disturb this status quo. Unfortunately,  it seems clear to our policy makers that loosely aligned Basobhar tribes alone will not be enough to secure our southern border. We must secure our southern frontiers with our own people!"
    G55_3_2_ministry_of_the_interior_title: "Managing Relations"
    G55_3_2_ministry_of_the_interior_desc: "We have adopted a policy of vassalizing the disorganized tribals within our lands, much to the chagrin of our Kheionai brethren. We have run into issues however, with many disputes between our tribal allies and our citizens flaring up. One of our senior ministers has proposed the creation of a new ministry, dedicated to handling the affairs of the settlers and the Basobhar, and the relations between the two groups."
    G55_3_3_develop_the_eneionam_title: "Develop The Eneionam"
    G55_3_3_develop_the_eneionam_desc: "We have acquired all the lands that surround the Eneionam, and have settled it with our own people. Now we must develop it into a rich land, in order to make it the wealthiest area of Devand. It will show all others the benefits of our rule, such that even the most stubborn of tribes will side with us!"
    G55_3_4_pathetic_pirates_title: "Pathetic Pirates"
    G55_3_4_pathetic_pirates_desc: "Amgremos, the first independent nékheis. Amgremos, the last independent bastion of Kimabhen culture. Amgremos, a haven of pirates, stalking the seas and damaging our trade with the east. We must conquer this rogue kheion, and put an end to their piratical ways!"
    G55_3_6_take_control_title: "Take Control"
    G55_3_6_take_control_desc: "Any sensible and well behaved child should take care of their elderly parents. This is the case for many civilizations, and we are no different. We have long since dwarfed our parent city, Degakheion, in both power and prestige. We must take the lead now, we will keep them safe and secure."

    #4th Column
    G55_4_2_up_the_eneionam_title: "Up The Eneionam"
    G55_4_2_up_the_eneionam_desc: "The Eneionam river is the lifeblood of our kheion. It feeds our crops and our people, and it is a vital artery for internal transport. Unfortunately, we do not control the entirety of its length. The tribes of the upper Eneionam have not yet bowed down to us, but with a bit of convincing, maybe they will change their tune."
    G55_4_3_dtsiaerh_allegiance_title: "Dtsiaerh Allegiance"
    G55_4_3_dtsiaerh_allegiance_desc: "The Dtsiaerh tribes are formidable and warlike. Their unfortunate positioning has seen them stuck between hostile Basobhar tribes to the south, Chendhyan raiders to the east, and Kheionai slavers to the north. Forced to fend for their survival for generations, our generals expected a long war to ensue when our settlers moved into their lands. However, it seems the Dtsiaerh have heard of our tribal vassalization policy, and their chiefs wish to see our Kylakas personally."
    G55_4_4_entice_alecandi_immigration_title: "Encourage Immigration"
    G55_4_4_entice_alecandi_immigration_desc: "Our existence has been fueled by immigration from Alecand. Events in Alecand have caused the small trickle of migrants that we are used to, and turned it into a wave. The ever-looming Kaydhano, constant warfare, and overcrowding have forced many Alecandi to leave the isle, in search of better opportunities on the mainland. Many of our ministers are arguing for improved coastal facilities in Eneion itself, in order to soak up as much of this immigration wave for ourselves."
    G55_4_5_secure_the_hinterlands_title: "Secure The Hinterlands"
    G55_4_5_secure_the_hinterlands_desc: "While we seek to conquer the southern kheions of Devand, we must also keep in mind the hinterlands of these cities. Full of unaligned tribals, who hold no love for us and our Kheionai brethren, they will be a permanent threat to our conquests for as long as they remain independent. They will bend the knee, either by choice or force."

    #5th Column
    G55_5_1_fill_the_library_title: "Fill The Library"
    G55_5_1_fill_the_library_desc: "The Trilidir library has yet to be filled. There are still empty bookshelves shelves in the library, a problem that our philosophers demand to be rectified. While we could just order books to be copied and brought in from Alecand, our philosophers see value in the ways of the Basobhar and our humble settlers, and seek state funding to write texts of their lives. Specifically, these philosophers seek to record the myths, tales, faith, traditions and languages of the Basobhar, and demand that the state sponsor their endeavors. We will support these philosophers, and store the texts they produce in The Trilidir Library, killing 2 birds with one stone."
    G55_5_2_windy_wine_title: "Windy Wine"
    G55_5_2_windy_wine_desc: "The windy plain between our great kheion and Besolakí has been noticed by many wine growers and merchants as a place greatly suited to the growing of wine, a pleasure desperately craved for by many aristocrats and philosophers. Our officials have put forward plans to set up massive vineyards across the windy plain, and tax all the immense profits that would be generated from them."
    G55_5_3_ruby_rush_title: "Ruby Rush"
    G55_5_3_ruby_rush_desc: "Deep within the Devandi highlands, our prospectors have discovered a great deposit of highly sought after, blood-red rubies near Lake Mteidhan. Already, many have moved to the area, hoping to mine rubies and sell them to merchants at a great profit. Our merchants and aristocrats demand infrastructure be built here to maintain and exploit the "Ruby Rush"."
    G55_5_4_copper_woods_title: "Copper Woods"
    G55_5_4_copper_woods_desc: "Within the forest north of Besolakí lies a great deposit of copper. Such a deposit has gone unnoticed, until now. Plans have been drawn up to build a series of mines in the area that will be invaluable to us in the production of cannons and other bronze equipment."
    G55_5_5_iron_mountain_title: "Iron Mountain"
    G55_5_5_iron_mountain_desc: "Our prospectors have discovered a massive deposit of easily mined iron in the lands of the Dtsiaerh tribes. Our diplomats have already bought the lands around the iron deposit, now we just need to begin mining it. Once the mining begins, we will finally have a consistent source of iron for ourselves, with no more need to rely on foreign iron imports from abroad."
